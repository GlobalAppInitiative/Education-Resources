General Resources
=================

- Codecademy_: Great for learning the very basic foundamental programming skills.
  Great for very beginner programmers learning their first language.
  However, learning new languages for syntax is very tedious.
  It is a great starting point for learning, but for the next step to go
  "above and beyond", I would recommend looking into some of the following
  sources. Codecademy is great for teaching the actual coding, but to gain
  experience from projects it may be better to look elsewhere.

- TeamTreeHouse_: For those who have the desire to learn something new
(and have a lot of time on their hands) this is a great option. Whether it be
iOS, html, Wordpress, design, or even some more fancy things like node.js
  - well Team Treehouse has it all. The site offers an expansive library of
  video tutorials and coding quizzes between every few video.
  While it is a very effective tool, it can be slow paced at times.
  While it does take time, working through the video tutorials will leave you
  with finished projects you can show off.

- `Mozilla Developer Tools`_(for web development): Reference this site for
  anything and everything web dev related. Google searches will most often
  return sources from W3 schools and Mozilla Dev Tools.
  While W3 schools offers many useful articles for web development, it is not
  always up the most accurate with current HTML5.

- StackOverflow_: Great resource for trying to solve problems that you have no
 idea where to look for.
